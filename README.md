# Data Structure Animations - Ford & Topp

This is a collection of algorithm animations for a C++ Data Structures and Algorithms course
(developed for the web course offering of CS361 from Old Dominion University, Norfolk Virginia).

Most of the animated code is taken from Ford & Topp,  Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ using STL,
2001  Pearson PH 0130858501

The animations are developed using the [AlgAE animation engine](https://github.com/sjzeil/AlgAE). AlgAE is 
currently distributed in source form only, so to prepare these demos, you will need to install and build AlgAE
first.
